# Client Miners

In the initial blockchain demonstration, we've created a small problem.  The `mine` endpoint is called on the server, which means we're the ones spending all of the electricity to generate a new block.  This won't do at all!

Miners want credit for the electricity they spend to mine a new block.  Right now, the server is simply recording a `0` as the sender.  We need to fix this to appropriately give credit where credit is due. 

Furthermore, the amount of work needed to actually mine a block is a bit low.  We need it to be harder to preserve the integrity of the chain.


# Task List

*Server*
Modify the server we created to:
* Remove the `proof_of_work` function from the server.
* Change `valid_proof` to require *6* leading zeroes.
* Add an endpoint called `last_block` that returns the last block in the chain
* Modify the `mine` endpoint to instead receive and validate or reject a new proof sent by a client.
* Receive an `id` from a `mine` request.
* Record that ID as the `sender` in the transaction that creates the coin.
* Return a message indicating success or failure.  Remember, a valid proof should fail for all senders except the first.

*Client Mining*
Create a client application that will:
* Request the last block from the `last_block` endpoint on the server
* Run the `proof_of_work` function until a valid proof is found, validating or rejecting each attempt
* Check for a file called `my_id`, open it if found, and load the ID
* Otherwise, print an error
* Print messages indicating that this has started and finished.  (Stretch: Add a timer)
* Modify it to generate proofs with *6* leading zeroes.
* When a valid proof is found, send it to the `mine` endpoint, along with the `id`.
* Print a message indicating the success or failure response from the server
* Add any coins granted to a simple integer total, and print the amount of coins the client has earned
* Handle non-json responses sent by the server in the event of an error
* Continue mining until the app is interrupted.
